Automate the process of configuring and verifying 
Microsoft Windows Server 2022 systems against the 
CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmark. 

The project includes a series of automated steps and scripts to align 
server configurations with the recommended CIS standards, which are widely 
recognised for enhancing the security and performance of systems.

The CIS Benchmarks are a set of best practice guidelines for securing IT 
systems and data against cyber threats. 
By aligning with these benchmarks, the project aims to significantly 
enhance the security posture of Windows Server 2022 environments.

Streamlined and scripted adjustments to system settings to comply with 
CIS Benchmark guidelines.

# Verification Procedures
Automated checks to verify each configuration against the CIS Benchmark, 
ensuring all standards are met.

# Reporting
